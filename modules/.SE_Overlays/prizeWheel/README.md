# Prize Wheel

###### Notes:
**This widget works as an active source! All data will be reset when the source is closed or reloaded!**
- Default setup is a 1000px X 1000px container, centered on the overlay editor
- Overlay Video and Image attempt to center themselves on load/update and will sometimes not show correctly while adjusting the settings. They will force center after 10 seconds.
- Having the bot respond in chat requires a 'botMsg' token from [jebaited.net](https://jebaited.net/)
